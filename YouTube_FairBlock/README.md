# YouTube - FairBlock


### The fair alternative to AdBlock.

Instead of blocking ads, it makes them more bearable and less annoying.
Watch YouTube videos without getting exasperated, but still support your favorite YouTubers.

### What does it do?

- automatically mute video ads
- skip video ads as soon as possible
- close popup ads as soon as they appear

...and keep you from getting insane, when the same annoying ad plays over and over again
