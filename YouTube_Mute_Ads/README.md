This is a small Script to mute video ads on YouTube automatically .


You want to help your favorite YouTuber by disabling your AdBlocker?  
But you don't want to hear the same, annoying ad, over and over again ?  
Then this is for you!

The script mutes advertisements before and while the video, it unmutes the video as soon as the actual video start's playing.


-
To keep it small, it only mutes ads on <i>www.youtube.com/watch?*</i> which is 99% of all videos you'll be watching.
